Project Context for Claude
Tools Developed
logit - Main aggregation and reporting tool
Default controller is 1
No zone specified means show all zones
Window defaults to range value if not specified
Uses separate queries for each measurement type
Clean, simple output format
logitdebug - Raw data inspection tool
Shows unaggregated data
Excludes noisy fields (measurement, host, topic)
Supports both formatted and raw output modes
InfluxDB Structure
Host: http://192.168.1.88:8086
Organization: Milano
Bucket: MWPWater
Measurement: mwp_sensors
Fields:
intervalFlow (summed in aggregations)
pressurePSI (averaged in aggregations)
temperatureF (averaged in aggregations)
amperage (averaged in aggregations)
Tags:
Controller (values 1-5)
Zone (values 1-16)
Code Style and Patterns
Clear separation of concerns between tools
Consistent error handling and validation
3. Command line flags support both long and short versions
Query building with string templates
Time windows from 1m to 12mo supported
Key Code Snippets
Main Query Builder
}
Time Window Definitions
}
Command Line Usage
Bash
raw
Current Status
Both tools are working and stable
Output is clean and readable
Error handling is robust
Ready for feature additions or enhancements
Next Steps (discussed but not implemented)
[Add any pending features or improvements we discussed]
Important Design Decisions
Separate queries for each measurement type instead of combining
Default controller but optional zone specification
Simple output format focusing on readability
Separate debug tool rather than debug mode in main tool
This context should help us quickly resume development where we left off.
where's the best place to put this file in this project directory

For a project like this, I'd recommend creating a docs directory in your project root and naming the file something like CONTEXT.md. Here's the structure:
one
You can create it with:
Bash
/
This is a common convention because:
docs/ is a standard location for project documentation
.md (Markdown) files are easily readable both in text editors and on platforms like GitHub
It keeps the documentation separate from the code but still within the project
Other developers (or yourself in the future) will know where to look for project documentation
Would you like me to suggest any other documentation we should add to the docs directory?

func buildQuery(bucket, timeRange, aggregateWindow, controller, zone string) string {
    // Build the zone filter based on whether it was specified
    var filterStr string
    if zone != "" {
        filterStr = fmt.Sprintf(`|> filter(fn: (r) => r["Controller"] == "%s" and r["Zone"] == "%s")`, controller, zone)
    } else {
        filterStr = fmt.Sprintf(`|> filter(fn: (r) => r["Controller"] == "%s")`, controller)
    }

    return fmt.Sprintf(`
        // First query: Get summed intervalFlow
        intervalFlow = from(bucket: "%s")
            |> range(start: -%s)
            |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "mwp_sensors")
            |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "intervalFlow")
            %s
            |> aggregateWindow(every: %s, fn: sum, createEmpty: false)
            |> yield(name: "intervalFlow")
        // ... similar queries for pressure, temperature, amperage ...
    `, bucket, timeRange, filterStr, aggregateWindow)
